   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in)
   - Most Companies are facing the following challenge
     + Can't ask the right data questions
     + Don't know where to find supporting data facts
     + Incapable of conducting correct data analysis
     + Unable to draw insightful data driven conclusions
   - The biggest Challenge is the difficulty to form a data-driven culture
   - Doing too much with too little outcomes
** Big Data Solution Providers
   - Most Data Scientists
     + Extremely high ego
     + Don't know how to communicate well with the business world
     + Showing off
       * amazing models that most people can't understand
       * artistic visualizations that most people can't read

The fact that we humans, who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles of nature, have been able to come this close to an understanding of the laws governing us and our universe is a great triumph, and I'm happy if I have made a small contribution. I want to share my excitement and enthusiasm about this quest.
So remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see, and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there's always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up. Where there's life, there's hope.
